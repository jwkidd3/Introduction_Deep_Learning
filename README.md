# Introduction Deep Learning

## Course Learning Outcomes
- Understand Neural Networks and basic techniques for using them effectively (dropout, batch normalization, data augmentation, etc.).
- Learn how to handle image data and use Convolutional Neural Networks for various imaging tasks.
- Learn how to handle text data and use Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformers for various Natural Language Processing tasks and for other tasks involving sequential data.
- Practice implementing these techniques from scratch using PyTorch
- Complete a Deep Learning project as part of team from start to end using real world data:
  - Research literature for the problem,
  - Prepare/clean data,
  - Apply the appropriate deep learning techniques,
  - Evaluate and communicate the results.
